# verify-changed-files

Verify that certain files or directories did or did not change during the workflow execution.

## Features

*   Boolean output indicating that there are uncommited changes.
*   List all files that changed during the workflow execution.
*   Restrict change detection to a subset of files.
    *   [Regex pattern](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Regular-Expressions) matching on a subset of files.

## Supported Platforms

*   [`ubuntu-*`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)
*   [`macos-*`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)
*   [`windows-*`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)

## Usage

> NOTE: :warning:
>
> *   This action only detects files that have pending uncommited changes generated during the workflow execution, for running a specific step when a file changes relative to the default branch or previous commit
>
>     See: https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files
> *   Detects files that were `Added`, `Copied`, `Modified`, `Unmerged`, `Unknown`, had their `Type changed`, `Unstaged` and `Renamed`.

```yaml
...
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Change text file
        run: |
          echo "Modified" > new.txt

      - name: Change file in directory
        run: |
          echo "Changed" > test_directory/new.txt

      - name: Verify Changed files
        uses: tj-actions/verify-changed-files@v7.1
        id: verify-changed-files
        with:
          files: |

             .(py|jpeg)$
             .(sql)$
             ^(mynewfile|custom)

      - name: Run step only when files change.
        if: steps.verify-changed-files.outputs.files_changed == 'true'
        run: |
          echo "Changed files: ${{ steps.verify_changed_files.outputs.changed_files }}"
        # Outputs: "Changed files: new.txt test_directory/new.txt"

        with:
          files: |
             new.txt
             test_directory

      - name: Perform action when test_directory changes
        if: contains(steps.verify-changed-files.outputs.changed_files, 'test_directory')
